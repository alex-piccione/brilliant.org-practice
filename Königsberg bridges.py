# Describes the KÃ¶nigsberg bridges as a graph

# A graph has Vertices and Edges
# every land is a vertex (N, S, E, W) and every bridge is an edge (1,2,3,4,5,6,7)

# To describe a second edge existing between two vertices, we need to add a third vertex
# Nord = 1
# West = 2
# Est = 3
# Sud = 4
# NW = 5 , new vertex between Nord and West
# SW = 6 , new vertex between Sud and West
